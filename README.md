# Project Pyke

# Overview

Project Pyke is a data analysis project that leverages SQL, Python, and Tableau to explore and visualize synthetic music streaming data. This project is designed to showcase a range of skills including database management, data analysis, and data visualization. It serves as an example of how data can be used to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making in the music industry.

# Project Structure

	•	SQL Scripts: SQL queries were written to create tables, insert data, and perform various analytical operations on the synthetic dataset.
	•	Python Scripts: Python was used to generate synthetic data using the Faker library and to insert this data into a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, Python scripts were used to export data into CSV files for visualization purposes.
	•	Tableau Visualizations: The project includes several Tableau sheets that provide dynamic visualizations of the streaming data, focusing on aspects like user demographics, artist popularity, and stream duration.

# Visualizations

	1.	User Demographics: Analyzes the age distribution of users to understand the primary audience for streaming services.
	2.	Streaming Over Time: Tracks the popularity of the top 3 artists over time.
	3.	Genre Popularity: Displays the different genres of the top 3 artists and their popularity.
	4.	Streaming Locations: Shows the geographic distribution of streams for the top 3 artists.

# Key Features

	•	Data Generation: Synthetic data generated for users, artists, songs, and streams, simulating real-world streaming service data.
	•	Database Management: Efficient data storage and retrieval using PostgreSQL.
	•	Data Visualization: Dynamic visualizations created in Tableau, with options for user interaction and filtering.

# Usage

This repository is for informational purposes only. The scripts and visualizations included are designed to demonstrate capabilities in data management, analysis, and visualization. They are not intended for direct installation or deployment.

# Future Work

Project Pyke serves as an initial sample of work, demonstrating foundational skills in data analysis, SQL, Python scripting, and Tableau visualization. The insights gained and the methodologies used here can be expanded upon and refined in future projects. The ideas and enhancements mentioned in this section represent potential directions for further exploration and development. These may be implemented under a different project name as part of a larger or more advanced initiative.
